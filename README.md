## Summary

I am a dedicated web developer focused on building solutions that genuinely align with customer needs. With experience across FinTech and fast-paced startups, I've worked with a variety of technologies—though modern web development is where my passion truly lies.

My strengths revolve around building web applications using MVC frameworks, especially Laravel, which remains my preferred and strongest technology. I'm highly comfortable in Linux-based environments and value the efficiency they bring to professional development workflows.

My long-term goal is simple: build impactful, high-quality web applications throughout my career. Whether in structured teams or rag-tag startup crews, I bring reliability, adaptability, and craftsmanship to every project.
